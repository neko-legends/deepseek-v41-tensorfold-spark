# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on TensorFold, 2x NVIDIA DGX Spark

Serve DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (the 2.9 bpw EXL3 pack) across two NVIDIA DGX Sparks, tensor-parallel over the 200 Gb/s
CX7 link, behind an OpenAI-compatible API. The engine is [TensorFold](https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold) 0.6.0
(pinned, unmodified submodule) plus two patches applied at image build: the two-Spark engine stack from the
[GLM-5.3-Flash recipe](https://github.com/jayleaton/glm53-tensorfold-spark) and a new DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash family
written for this model: CSA2 attention with FP8 KV rows and the lightning indexer, Single-Pass mHC, Engram rows read
from local NVMe, EXL3 expert and dense kernels tuned for GB10, **exact** DSpark speculative decoding, CED
bounded-replay prefill, 4 request slots over a shared FP8 KV pool (4 x 300K tokens), sessions with an NVMe tier,
prepared per-rank folders for ~40 s restarts, structured output and DSML tool calls.

> **Four Sparks:** the same engine also runs TP=4 on four DGX Sparks behind a switch (`patches/0003`,
> `scripts/serve4.sh`): decode 1.68-1.75x a SGLang TP4 deployment of the FP8 checkpoint on the same four nodes
> (prose 63.4 / code 100.2 tok/s over 1k-160k prompts; 4 streams 119.2 tok/s aggregate), with slower cold prompt
> reading. Setup, numbers and limits: [docs/FOUR_SPARKS.md](FOUR_SPARKS.md). With `patches/0004` the four ranks
> read long prompts as a pipeline: a cold 160k-token prompt in ~39 s instead of ~83 s
> ([docs/PREFILL_SPEED.md](PREFILL_SPEED.md)).

> **Work in progress.** Measured on one pair of Sparks, against one baseline. Knobs, defaults and numbers may change.

## Results

Hardware: two DGX Sparks (GB10, 128 GB unified memory each), one QSFP cable between their CX7 ports, RoCE. Weights:
[`dealignai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-UNCENSORED-EXL3-2.9bpw`](https://huggingface.co/dealignai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-UNCENSORED-EXL3-2.9bpw),
the uncensored variant of [Mia-AiLab's 2.9 bpw EXL3 pack](https://huggingface.co/Mia-AiLab/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-EXL3-2.9bpw)
(same layout). Baseline: [MiaAI-Lab's 2x DGX Spark vLLM kit](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4.1-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks)
on the same pair and the same weights (vLLM TP=2, DSpark k=3, its moe_x kernel engaged), measured with our own
clients on 2026-10-01. Our side: the configuration in [`config/prod.env.example`](../config/prod.env.example) on the
engine these patches build. Raw files: [`results/`](../results/README.md).

### Speed (tok/s)

| | **TensorFold (this recipe)** | MiaAI-Lab vLLM kit | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Code, 1 stream, greedy | **82.8** | 41.9-45.0 | **1.8-2.0x** |
| Prose (essay), 1 stream, greedy | **44.25** | 32.5 | 1.36x |
| Structured (count 1-200), 1 stream, greedy | **117.8** | 38.0 (50.2 on a JSON task) | **2.3-3.1x** |
| 1 stream, decode aggregate | **85.1** | 32.2 | **2.6x** |
| 2 streams, decode aggregate | **70.3** | 46.7 | 1.5x |
| 4 streams, decode aggregate | **96.6** | 37.6 | **2.6x** |
| Cold prefill 8K / 32K / 64K / 128K (CED replay, the default) | **1,833 / 2,043 / 2,068 / 1,953** | 1,073 / 1,075 / 1,060 / 1,031 | **1.7-1.95x** |
| Cold prefill, `TF_DSV41_PREFILL=full` (no replay) | 969 / 1,004 / 1,003 / 876 | same | 0.85-0.95x |
| Start to ready | **34-44 s** | 378 s | ~9x |

At temperature 0.7 the single-stream cells are code 75.0, prose 45.3, structured 117.6. The decode cells are G13
(engine `767ad9f` with `TF_DSV41_MHC_CUDA`, `ATTN_CUDA` and `DENSE_V3` on): against the same engine with the three off,
in the same session, code +1.3%, prose +7.2%, C2 +3.9%, C4 +2.8%, and the 1-token verify step 26.8 -> ~23.4-24.8 ms
([`docs/campaign/G13-RESULTS.md`](campaign/G13-RESULTS.md)). Before G13 (`38f6500`): code 79.0-81.5, prose
40.9-41.2, structured 116.6, C1 / C2 / C4 82-83 / 67.1 / 93.5.

### Quality and robustness

| | **TensorFold** | kit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Teacher-forced top-1 agreement with the kit (8 prompts x 2,048 positions) | 0.9961 (first copy of each prompt: 0.9502); the same with the G13 rewrites on or off | 1 by definition |
| MMLU-200, 0-shot, greedy, thinking off | **87.5%** | 87.5% |
| MMLU-200 with a 20-question preamble (~2.1K-token prompts), replay vs full prefill | 81.1% / 81.1% (178 of 180 answers equal) | - |
| Needle at 32K / 128K / 299K (replay prefill) | found (19.9 s / 74.0 s / 195 s) | - |
| Multi-step tool chains (`bench/tooleval/chains.py`, 6 scenarios, 12 points), thinking off / high | 11 / 12, 11 / 12 (G13: off 11 / 12) | - |
| tool-eval-bench category C (multi-step), thinking off | 8 / 8 (score 100) | - |
| Structured output: 12 JSON-schema cases + 10 tool-choice cases (drafted == serial == batched, valid, no markup) | 22 / 22 | - |
| 30-minute soak (1-4 streams, cancels, disconnects, long prompts) | 529 requests, 0 errors, drained | - |
| Stress: one 299K prefill + three 64K prompts decoding 2,048 tokens each | every stream completes; 299K prefill **175 s**; host RSS growth ~0.7 GiB a rank; worker MemAvailable minimum 3.0-3.7 GiB (the boot budget, not growth) | 4.40 GiB at <= 256K (lighter load) |

Top-1, MMLU-200 and tool chains (thinking off) were re-run on the current engine (G13, `767ad9f` + the three
rewrites): top-1 0.9961, the same as with the rewrites off (they change no bits; the G10 / G11 runs on `38f6500` read
0.9963), MMLU-200 87.5% (175 / 200), chains 11 / 12, drafted == serial in every run. Structured output, soak and the
chains with thinking ran on `38f6500`; the stress row on `a6f5792` (G12); the 20-question MMLU and the needles on the
G7 engine commit with the same prefill path. On the current engine a 299K prefill takes 175 s inside the stress (three other streams
decoding), against 181-185 s before the G12 memory fixes; the needles were not re-run.

### What measures what

- **Decode cells, ours:** `m2bench` (inside the engine, both ranks, no HTTP; `scripts/serve.sh run`), tok/s from the
  first to the last token of a 384-token reply, the median of the repetitions (2 by default), request slots sized
  for 16K tokens. Prompts: an LRU-cache
  class with tests (code), a 400-word essay (prose), counting 1 to 200 (structured). The cells are one G13 run of the
  production configuration (`results/campaign/G13-20261003/m2-g13cs-combo.json`); earlier configurations gave ranges
  over several runs (G10 / G11 in the development log).
- **Decode cells, kit:** HTTP clients (`glmbench`, `multiturn` of the GLM recipe): code = a 64-token code reply
  (41.9) and a 512-token one (45.0), prose = a 200-token essay, structured = count 1-200, thinking off.
- **2 / 4 streams:** both sides report decode aggregate = all tokens / (last token - first token). Ours mixes code,
  prose, a JSON task and a copy-heavy edit, every other stream at T = 0.7; the kit's mix is its chat / code prompts,
  256 tokens each. Same metric, different prompts.
- **Prefill:** one request, cold, after a 2K warm-up. Ours: fresh random text through `m2bench --prefill` (measured
  at the G7 engine commit; G8-G11 and G13 changed decode paths only, and G12's host-memory fixes were measured only
  on the 299K stress prefill: 175 s). The kit: a repeated filler document over HTTP.
  Repeated fillers can make Engram reads look cheaper, so the kit's cells are not pessimistic.
- **Start to ready:** ours = `docker run` to `/v1/models` answering, with prepared folders and compiled kernels
  cached, page cache dropped first. The kit's = its start script to `/health` on freshly rebooted nodes. The first
  start of a new image is slower (kernel builds, ~80 s) and the very first writes the prepared folders (~95 GB a node).
- **Top-1:** the kit's `prompt_logprobs` (top 5) over 8 built-in prompts repeated to 2,048 tokens
  ([`results/kit-baseline/oracle-kit.json`](../results/kit-baseline/oracle-kit.json)), our engine teacher-forced on the
  same token ids. "First copy" counts only each prompt's first pass, before the model can copy itself.
- **Not RigMark.** No RigMark receipt exists for this model yet; every cell comes from the clients above.

[`docs/RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md) has every table, the lever-by-lever history and the negatives;
[`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md) how to rerun each cell.

### What "exact" means here, and what is approximate

- **Exact:** speculative decoding never changes a reply. Every verify row is the serial step at its position (row-
  invariant kernels) and its token is the request's keyed choice at that absolute position, so drafted == serial at
  T = 0 and at T > 0, and batched == alone. Every benchmark run checks it (`exact_all`).
- **Approximate by design, on in the measured config:**
  - CED decoder bounded replay for prompts (`TF_DSV41_PREFILL=replay`, DeepSeek's own technique: the decoder half
    runs only over a prompt's last 128 tokens). `full` is the exact prefill at about the kit's speed.
  - Routed-expert pruning in decode (`TF_DSV41_EXPERT_TOPP=0.85`, at least 3 experts, renormalized): +5% decode,
    MMLU-200 88.5% alone. Delete three lines of the config to serve the unpruned model.
  - mHC mixing weights in bf16 (`TF_DSV41_MHC_FN=bf16`): +2-5% prose, top-1 vs the kit 0.9963.
- **Not bit-identical to the kit.** Different kernels and summation orders; the agreement is the top-1 row above.

### Strict mode: every precision trade off

The same engine and the G13 rewrites (which change no bits) with every knob that trades precision turned off:
`TF_DSV41_EXPERT_TOPP=0` (no expert pruning), `EXPERT_RENORM=orig`, `MHC_FN=fp32`, `KIT_ROUNDING=0`, `LOGITS=fp32`,
`INDEX_KV=bf16`, `PREFILL=full` (no bounded replay). The fast prefill GEMMs and the fused prefill attention stay on.
Measured in G13, same build, same session ([`docs/campaign/G13-RESULTS.md`](campaign/G13-RESULTS.md)):

| | strict | production | kit | strict / kit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Code, 1 stream, greedy | **76.9** | 82.8 | 41.9-45.0 | 1.71-1.83x |
| Prose, 1 stream, greedy | **44.2** | 44.25 | 32.5 | 1.36x |
| Structured, 1 stream, greedy | **111.9** | 117.8 | 38.0-50.2 | 2.24-2.95x |
| 1 / 2 / 4 streams, decode aggregate | **79.0 / 64.0 / 89.5** | 85.1 / 70.3 / 96.6 | 32.2 / 46.7 / 37.6 | 2.45x / 1.37x / 2.38x |
| Cold prefill 8K / 32K / 64K / 128K | **915 / 965 / 959 / 923** | (replay) 1,833-2,068 | 1,073 / 1,075 / 1,060 / 1,031 | **0.85-0.90x** |
| Teacher-forced top-1 vs the kit | 0.9963 | 0.9961 | 1 | |

Decode costs 5-9% against production (prose at T = 0 is level only because the strict reply drafts a little better on
that prompt; at T = 0.7 it is -6.9%), and is still 1.4-2.9x the kit. Prefill without replay is below the kit. Strict
MMLU and tool chains were not run.

### Where we are not at 2x

Prose (1.36x) and 2 streams (1.5x). Prose drafts poorly: DSpark keeps ~1.6 tokens a round on prose against ~3.8 on
code, so prose speed is the verify window's cost. A 1-row window is ~23.4 ms since G13 (26.9 before) against a
bandwidth floor of ~17 ms a rank (the 2.9 bpw weights read once), and the second row costs ~6 ms more because a
second token brings ~5 new experts a layer. That is why G13's rewrites helped prose (+7.2%) far more than code (+1.3%:
code verifies ~4.6 rows a round, where the savings are smaller). 2 streams pair a code stream with a T = 0.7 prose stream, so the prose stream sets the pace.
[`docs/DECODE.md`](DECODE.md) has the roofline and what was tried.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- two DGX Sparks with their CX7 ports cabled and addressed (one link subnet), Docker with the NVIDIA runtime on both,
  and passwordless ssh from the head to the worker over the link;
- on each node's local NVMe: ~100 GB for the weights, ~95 GB for the Engram shards, ~95 GB for the prepared
  folders, and room for the session tier (`TF_DSV41_SESSION_DISK_GIB`, 128 GB by default);
- nothing else on the GPUs: the stack plans for a 4-5 GiB MemAvailable floor out of 128 GB a node.

**1. Clone and configure** (on the head):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jayleaton/deepseek-v41-tensorfold-spark.git
cd deepseek-v41-tensorfold-spark
cp config/prod.env.example config/prod.env
$EDITOR config/prod.env      # every <placeholder>: WORKER_SSH, HEAD_IP, the paths on each node; check the NIC names
```

**2. Weights** (on both nodes, byte-identical):

```bash
hf download dealignai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-UNCENSORED-EXL3-2.9bpw --local-dir <HEAD_MODEL>    # and <WORKER_MODEL>
```

**3. Engram shards.** The EXL3 packs do not carry the Engram tables (layers 1 and 14, ~101 GB each). They come from
DeepSeek's original checkpoint; each rank keeps its half of the hash heads (~47 GiB a layer) on local NVMe:

```bash
mkdir -p <src> && hf download deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash model.safetensors.index.json --local-dir <src>
python3 scripts/pack_engram.py --src <src> --list                 # the shard files that hold the tables
hf download deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash <those files> --local-dir <src>
python3 scripts/pack_engram.py --src <src> --config <HEAD_MODEL>/config.json --out <HEAD_ENGRAM> --rank 0
python3 scripts/pack_engram.py --src <src> --config <HEAD_MODEL>/config.json --out <dir> --rank 1   # copy to <WORKER_ENGRAM> on the worker
python3 scripts/pack_engram.py --src <src> --config <HEAD_MODEL>/config.json --check <HEAD_ENGRAM> --rank 0
```

`pack_engram.py` writes the format the engine reads (`engram-l{1,14}-r{rank}of2.bin`) from the source tensors'
raw bytes; it is tested against the engine's reader on synthetic tables. The measured runs used shards packed by
the MiaAI-Lab kit (`./start.sh pack`), which writes the same format; `--check` compares either with the source.

**4. Build, check, start:**

```bash
scripts/serve.sh build        # docker/Dockerfile: TensorFold v0.6.0 + patches/, shipped to the worker, then prebuild
scripts/serve.sh preflight    # image on both nodes, weights, Engram shards, RoCE ports, free ports, idle GPUs
scripts/serve.sh start        # memory gate, rank 1 then rank 0, /v1/models, slot check, canary
```

`build` ends with `scripts/serve.sh prebuild`: the CUDA extensions (15, the G13 kernels included) are compiled into
the `CACHE_VOL` volume on both nodes with no weights loaded, so no extension is built beside the weights. Run it again
after clearing the volume. The first start compiles the Triton kernels and writes the prepared rank folders
(`TF_DSV41_PREPARED_WRITE=1`, ~95 GB a node, several minutes); later starts read them back in ~40 s. Then:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"model": "DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-TF",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 17 * 23?"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}'
scripts/serve.sh status | logs [0|1] | canary | stop | restart
```

**5. Run it unattended** (optional): a watchdog tick every minute (heals after 3 bad ticks, at most every 30 min)
and a start at boot.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user && cp scripts/systemd/dsv41-* ~/.config/systemd/user/
$EDITOR ~/.config/systemd/user/dsv41-*.service        # WorkingDirectory= this checkout
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now dsv41-tf-watchdog.timer && systemctl --user enable dsv41-boot-start.service
```

`scripts/serve.sh` drops the page cache on both nodes around a start (`DROP_CACHES=1`: needs `sudo -n` or root for
`/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`; otherwise it logs and continues). [`docs/OPERATIONS.md`](OPERATIONS.md) covers the
knobs, the memory gates, the watchdog, and how to turn each lever off.

## API

OpenAI-compatible on `HOST:PORT` (`127.0.0.1:8000` by default: put your own proxy and authentication in front):
`/v1/chat/completions` (streaming, tool calls, `response_format`), `/v1/completions` (text or token ids),
`/tokenize`, `/v1/models` (`max_model_len`), `/health`, `/metrics`.

Thinking follows DeepSeek-V4.1's encoding (`Reasoning Effort: N (range 1-100)`), on by default
(`TF_DSV41_THINKING=0` turns it off). Both the top-level `reasoning_effort` and
`chat_template_kwargs.reasoning_effort` are read (the kwargs win):

| value | thinking | effort |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `none`, `minimal` | off | - |
| `low` | on | 50 |
| `medium`, `high` (default: `TF_DSV41_DEFAULT_EFFORT`) | on | 75 |
| `xhigh`, `max` | on | 100 |
| an integer 1-100 | on | that |

`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` (or `thinking`) true / false sets the mode directly. Note: the kit's vLLM
path renders `low` as 25; we keep DeepSeek's 50.

## The engine

`vendor/TensorFold` is upstream TensorFold v0.6.0, unmodified. `patches/` holds four patches, applied in order by the
Dockerfile:

| patch | what | licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`0001-spark-stack-060.patch`](../patches/0001-spark-stack-060.patch) | the GLM-5.3-Flash two-Spark engine (`families/glm5_next/spark/`) rebased onto 0.6.0, the CUDA communicator interface (`cuda/comm.py`), the family `CUDA_SERVE` hook (`cli.py`, `families/glm5_next/__init__.py`), the server's descriptor fix (`server/cancellation.py`), packaging (`pyproject.toml`), recipes and tests |
| [`0002-deepseek-v41-family.patch`](../patches/0002-deepseek-v41-family.patch) | `families/deepseek_v41/` and its tests, the EXL3 linear's device-side skip (`cuda/exl3/linear.*`), fp64 in `cuda/comm.py`, `--kv-dtype fp8` (`cli_args.py`), model aliases in the GLM server, packaging, NOTICE entries |
| [`0003-four-sparks.patch`](../patches/0003-four-sparks.patch) | four Sparks (TP=4): whole-128-block uneven splits (`weights.block_bounds`), `--tp 4 --rank 0..3`, N-way rank agreement and plan link, RoCE post rotation, csa2 sources in `package-data`, `/health` draft counters, sync-free expert counts, opt-in prefill profile, `tests/test_dsv41_tp4.py`; see [`docs/FOUR_SPARKS.md`](FOUR_SPARKS.md) |
| [`0004-prefill-speed.patch`](../patches/0004-prefill-speed.patch) | faster prompt reading on four Sparks, all opt-in: pipelined prompts across the ranks (`pipe.py`, `TF_DSV41_PREFILL_PIPE`), split selections (`TF_DSV41_INDEX_SPLIT`), overlapped exchanges (`TF_DSV41_PREFILL_OVERLAP`), the `ppbench.py` prototype, `tests/test_dsv41_pipe.py` and `test_dsv41_overlap.py`; see [`docs/PREFILL_SPEED.md`](PREFILL_SPEED.md) |

0001 and 0002 together are every engine change two-Spark production runs (development commit `767ad9f`, 390 files over v0.6.0): applying
them to v0.6.0 reproduces that tree except for reworded comments and the excluded draft-vocabulary files
([`docs/ENGINE.md`](ENGINE.md) lists each difference).

[`docs/ENGINE.md`](ENGINE.md) explains how the patches were produced, how to get the same tree as a git branch,
and how to run the engine's test suites. [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) summarises the model and the
TP=2 split.

## What is not solved

- **The worker's memory floor.** In the 4 x 300K stress the worker's MemAvailable bottoms out at 3.0-3.7 GiB early in
  the 299K prefill, under our own 5 GiB target and the 4 GiB admission floor (nothing new is admitted below it). It
  comes from the boot budget (the 4 x 300K KV pool) and the first segments' CUDA reservations, not from host growth
  (fixed in G12). Open. `CONTEXT=196608` lowers the exposure.
- **Prose and 2 streams** are not at 2x (above).
- **Two G13 rewrites ship off.** The shortened decode MoE chain (`TF_DSV41_MOE_FUSED`) and the CSA2 indexer /
  compressor on a side stream (`TF_DSV41_BRANCHES`) are exact but did not help: MOE_FUSED measured +0.7 ms on a 1-row
  window, and BRANCHES left the 1-row window unstable between boots (26.2 / 31.5 ms, +2.25 ms on average). Both are in
  the engine, default 0. The CUDA attention core in `TF_DSV41_ATTN_CUDA` is slower than Triton on its own and helps
  only with the top-k beside it.
- **`/health`** reported `drafted_total` / `accepted_total` as 0 for this family before patch 0003 wired them.
- **Vision** is not wired for this family.
- **No trimmed draft-head vocabulary is shipped** (`TF_DSV41_DRAFT_HEAD=trim`, off by default and not adopted). The
  development ranking was counted from private chat transcripts and is excluded, so `trim` needs
  `TF_DSV41_DRAFT_VOCAB=<file>` and `tests/test_dsv41_draft_head.py::test_shipped_ranking` fails. A ranking of your
  own traffic (`scripts/campaign/draftvocab.py`) or of public text (the GLM recipe's `bench/draftvocab_public.py`
  method on this tokenizer) can be used.

## Current focus

**G13: decode kernel rewrites** (engine `767ad9f`, [`docs/campaign/G13-RESULTS.md`](campaign/G13-RESULTS.md)).
Five rewrites from the rewrite study ([`docs/campaign/REWRITE-PLAN.md`](campaign/REWRITE-PLAN.md)), each behind
a lever that defaults to 0, each exact (drafted == serial, same gate top-1). Three are on in the config:

- `TF_DSV41_MHC_CUDA`: an mHC boundary as one CUDA launch (1-row window -1.3 ms).
- `TF_DSV41_ATTN_CUDA`: CSA2's decode attention core and the indexer's top-k in CUDA (-0.7 ms).
- `TF_DSV41_DENSE_V3`: the dense EXL3 linears over a 16-byte-coalesced repack (-1.2 ms at 2-16 rows).

Together: the 1-token step 26.8 -> ~23.4-24.8 ms, prose +7.2% (44.25 tok/s), code +1.3% (82.8), C2 +3.9%, C4 +2.8%;
gate top-1 0.9961, MMLU-200 87.5%, tool chains pass. `TF_DSV41_MOE_FUSED` and `TF_DSV41_BRANCHES` ship off (no
gain, above). `scripts/serve.sh build` now prebuilds every CUDA extension, the new ones included.

**Fixed in G12** (engine `a6f5792`, [`docs/campaign/G12-RESULTS.md`](campaign/G12-RESULTS.md)): host memory
growth in long prompts (torch's embedded mimalloc kept cross-thread frees; ~0.7 GiB a rank now, was 4.1-5.6), the
19-minute stall (transparent-huge-page compaction; `MIMALLOC_ALLOW_THP=0`), and the fast-prefill segmentation
dependence (RoPE tables in fixed blocks).

**Still open:** the worker's boot-time memory floor of ~3-3.7 GiB in the stress; where MOE_FUSED's isolated gain goes
inside the window graph (an nsys run); BRANCHES' slow boot; strict-mode MMLU and tool chains; the 2K anomaly and the
~11% gap between HTTP and in-engine prefill in upstream's `prefill_cold`.
